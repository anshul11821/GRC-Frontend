/**
 * Tiny stale-while-revalidate cache for GET data, shared across the whole app via a
 * module-level cache. Repeat navigations render cached data instantly and revalidate in
 * the background — so moving between Dashboard / Learnings / Desk / Career feels instant
 * after the first load. Keyed by a stable string (e.g. "learnings:grc101").
 *
 * The map lives for as long as the JS module graph does, which is *not* as long as the tab: a
 * plain browser refresh drops it, and every screen went back to a cold network wait for rows it
 * had just shown. So each entry is mirrored into sessionStorage and read back by
 * `hydrateQueryCache()` on boot. sessionStorage rather than localStorage because this is one
 * learner's own progression, and a per-tab store already dies at exactly the point the data stops
 * being theirs to show; `userKey()` namespaces it besides, since a second account signing in on
 * the same browser must never inherit the first one's tree.
