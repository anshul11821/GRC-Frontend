/**
 * The study card (form 03) — read to understand · nothing due. See docs/FORM_LANGUAGE.md.
 *
 * **The only borderless form, and the absence of the border is load-bearing**: it is what tells the
 * mentee nothing is owed here. Everything else on the desk has an edge because everything else
 * either wants something back or came from somewhere that has to be credited. This does neither.
 *
 * The rule that goes with it: *the moment it acquires a button it must become a step marker or a
 * prompt well.* If you find yourself adding an action here, you are building a different form —
 * a borderless card with a submit button tells the learner nothing is due and then asks for
 * something, which is the one lie the silhouette can tell.
 *
 * Exact tokens: ground `--gf-steel-tint` #e2eff6 · body `--gf-ink-2` #4e5a6b · heading
 * `--gf-ink` #131c28 · meta `--gf-steel` #0b6e99. Serif body, because this is prose to be read
 * rather than fields to be scanned.
 *
 * `GivenNote` in workspaces/kit.tsx is the compact inline variant of this same silhouette — same
 * borderless steel, sized for a single line of given context rather than a passage.
